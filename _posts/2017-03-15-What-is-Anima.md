Anima is a modern, graphical operating system designed around the needs of the modern internet user.

The operating system itself consists of the following architecutral layers:

* A modern 64 bit kernel (currently, a Linux kernel)
* Quokka: A browser doubling as runtime (a fork of Mozilla Firefox)
* HuX (Heirloom Unix): A low level wrapper library around libc.
* junior: A high level javascript (ES6/CommonJS) SDK containing all the functionality an app developer may need.
* A set of userspace servers.
